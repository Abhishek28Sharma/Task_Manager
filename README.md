## 🧠 Design Decisions

- 🔄 Client-side filtering for fast performance
- 🔗 Simple prop drilling (scalable with Context/Redux later)
- 🎨 Tailwind for rapid UI development

---

## Design Assumptions & Trade-offs

- Derived State: Filtering is performed on the client-side list rather than making a new API call for every filter change. This reduces server load and provides instant UI transitions.

- Prop Drilling: For this specific scope, props were passed directly from the TaskManager to children. For a larger app, a Context API or Redux would be used.

- Tailwind for Speed: Chosen to prioritize "Functionality over Visual Design" while still maintaining a polished appearance.
